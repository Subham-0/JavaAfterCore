What is Thread Starvation?
Thread starvation happens when a thread keeps waiting for a resource (like a lock, CPU time, or I/O) but never gets a chance to run because other threads keep getting preference.

In short:
A thread is alive but not progressing because it’s always being skipped.

Causes of Thread Starvation:
Unfair locks
With new ReentrantLock(false) (default), a new thread can sometimes “jump ahead” in acquiring the lock.
Old waiting threads may starve if this keeps happening.
Thread priorities
If high-priority threads keep running, low-priority ones may never get CPU time.
Resource hogging
A few threads constantly hold a shared resource (like DB connection, file, or CPU) → others starve.

How to Prevent Starvation?
Use fair locks → new ReentrantLock(true).
Ensures FIFO order → no starvation.
Avoid relying heavily on thread priorities.
Design code so that long-running tasks don’t block resources for too long.
Use higher-level concurrency utilities (like Semaphore, BlockingQueue, ExecutorService) which handle fairness better.
